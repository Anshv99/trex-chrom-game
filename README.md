# chrome-trex-game
A game made in pure javaScript HTML and CSS



I have build the popular Dino Chrome Game in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no fancy frameworks required! We also will not be using Canvas, we are going to be using pure JavaScript logic for everything!

I like this tutorial as we really focus on nodes, so adding Children to parents using .appendChild(), but also removing them using .removeChild() and a few others.
